# What do I do?

When it comes to technologies, most recently I've been focusing on serverless
solutions on AWS Cloud, writing code mostly in Python and JavaScript.

While being a backend engineer for the better part of my career, I'm not afraid of doing some
frontend or infrastructure work whenever needed.

I also like sharing my knowledge and over the years I've had a chance to speak at a few meetups and conferences. Most
recently I've also been giving guest lectures at the Silesian University of
Technology, where I'm completing my PhD studies.

Whenever I'm not coding, I'm probably wandering in the mountains or assembling a new LEGO set with my wife.

# What I've been working on recently

Recently, I've been mostly working on open-source projects in Serverless Framework ecosystem such as:

- [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless)
- [Serverless Compose](https://github.com/serverless/compose)
- [Serverless Python Requirements plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-python-requirements)
- [Serverless Azure Functions plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-azure-functions)
- [Serverless Google Cloud Functions plugin](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-google-cloudfunctions)

In addition to that, I've also been working on projects like:

- Building a data acquisition pipeline for IoT data from Autonomous Guided Vehicles
- Building a data lake and data processing pipeline in Microsoft Azure
- Edge analytics on Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano
- Preparing for AWS Solutions Architect Professional certification
- Various Discord, Slack, and Telegram bots
- ...and many more!

# A small configuration snippet from a Terraform project that I was working on recently

```hcl
resource "azurerm_eventhub" "eventhub" {
  name                = var.eventhub_name
  namespace_name      = azurerm_eventhub_namespace.eventhub_namespace.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  partition_count     = 1
  message_retention   = 1

  capture_description {
    enabled = true
    encoding = "Avro"
    interval_in_seconds = 300
    destination  {
      name = "EventHubArchive.AzureBlockBlob"
      blob_container_name = azurerm_storage_container.storage_container.name
      storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.storage_account.id
      archive_name_format = "{Namespace}/{EventHub}/{PartitionId}/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}/{Hour}/{Minute}"
    }
  }
}
```
